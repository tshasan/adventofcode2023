# Advent of Code 2023 Solutions :christmas_tree: :snake:

Welcome to my repository where I'm sharing my solutions to the [Advent of Code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023) challenges. These solutions are written in Python 3.11.6, and I'm tackling these challenges as a way to improve my Python skills.

## My Approach

- **Language:** Python 3.11.6
- **Libraries:** None (No external libraries used)
- **Skill Level:** Beginner to Intermediate

Each day, I take the challenge input and store it in a `.txt` file. My Python scripts then read from these text files to process the input data and solve the challenges.

## Structure of the Repository
- * is a placeholder for the day for example day1.py
- Each day's challenge is stored in a separate folder named `DayXX` where `XX` is the day number.
- Inside each folder, you'll find two files:
  - `day*.txt`: The challenge input data.
  - `day*.py`: My Python script that solves the challenge.

## Running the Solutions

To run any of my solutions, simply navigate to the day's folder and run the Python script:

```bash
cd adventofcode2023
python day*.py
